Born and raised in Durango, Mexico, I consider El Paso, TX my second home – a fronterizo by choice. I'm an Assistant Professor at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas, Austin, and Associate Director of Research at the Center for the Study of Race and Democracy (CSRD).

My research focuses on identity portfolios – the fluid and situational identities immigrants develop.  I also examine voter turnout, political participation, and public opinion among Latino immigrants. Other academic interests include issues related to Latinos and voting rights, border issues, and Mexican politics.

These areas inform my teaching courses on immigration, race, ethnicity, Latino politics, and social science methods. For a deeper dive into my research and teaching, visit the CV and Research sections.

In line with my continuous interest in public opinion and Latino politics, I collaborate with Univision News as their Director for Polling and Data.

When I'm not teaching or crunching numbers, you'll probably find me running or playing  with my son Diego, and learning from him.
