## Overview
 
My research centers around the idea that immigrants develop portfolios of identities; I suggest that these identities are fluid, situational, and are used instrumentally. My current book manuscript explores these dynamics with a multi-method approach. I use a unique repeated cross-sectional sample survey, taking advantage of the numerous individual observations within a specific cohort and time period. I employ a hierarchical age period cohort analysis (HAPC) in the form of cross-classified models in which observations across the different surveys are nested within time periods and cohorts. The qualitative and quantitative  evidence show the way in which Latino immigrants have developed and used these portfolios of identities.
